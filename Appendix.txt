The calculation approaches of COS, RMS, SMS and CMS:
COS. The 5-Operators Selection proposed by Offutt et al. [12] is the approach chosen in this paper. The 5 operators include the relational, logical, arithmetic, absolute, and unary insertion operators. For Major, we use 'LVR', 'AOR', 'ROR', 'LOR', and 'ORU' among all mutators as the implementation of COS. Then the mutation score computed on the mutants generated by these 5 mutators is used as the metric for measuring the effectiveness of test suites.
RMS. To implement RMS, given the ratio n% of selected mutants, we keep randomly selecting one of the remaining mutants with equal probability until there are n% mutants selected among all mutants. Finally, the mutation score computed by these mutants is the metric provided by RMS. In this paper, n=30.
 SMS. To select the subsuming mutants for computing mutation scores, we use the matrix which records all test cases that kill a mutant.  Then we select all the mutants, which are not subsumed by other mutants, to compute a mutation score as the metric.
CMS. To implement CMS, we first cluster all the mutants into different clusters and then select one mutant from each cluster to compute mutation scores. Before clustering, we need to collect feature data for each mutant. In this paper, an instance for a mutant is a 0-1 list based on the matrix. For example, the instance of m is [1, 0, 1, 0], which means that the first and third test case kills m and the other two test cases do not kill m. Then, the k-means algorithm is applied to all mutant instances to classify the mutants into different clusters. Here, we set the “k” equaling to the number of selected mutants by SMS. Among each cluster, the mutants are guaranteed to be killed by similar test cases. After that, the selection is obtained by randomly selecting one mutant from each cluster. Finally, the mutation score computed by these mutants is the metric provided by CMS.
